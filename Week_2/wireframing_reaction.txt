In this article about wireframing, the author suggests this way is a very efficient tool. She gives us five steps on how to wireframe. First and foremost, we need to know what the problem is. If we do not even know what problem we need to deal with, we definitely cannot get a proper solution. Secondly, we need to do some sketches to avoid some issues that will make our solutions not clear or not successful. Thirdly, we need feedbacks. It is similar to doing homework at school. We always need feedbacks so that we can improve. Then, we need to get to know tools to help us turn sketches to products. Proper practices make perfect. Last but not the least, we have to figure out who are our audience. We will not want to design for the wrong people. After reading this article, I think I get the idea of wireframing and will start to use it.
